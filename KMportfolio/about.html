                 <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>

                    <p>I have always been passionate about computers and how computers work. I have also independently studied a small percentage of consumer-side troubleshooting methods and that lit a fire in me to learn more. I am currently a student at the <b> College of western Idaho</b> getting my <i>Software development degree</i> </p>
                    <p> I am working with the <b>College of Western Idaho</b> on <i>web development techniques, team building </i> and <i>problem-solving skills</i>.  As it is currently my first introduction to <i>software development</i> I am a little nervous but extremely excited to work in this industry.  </p>
